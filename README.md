For the Digital Signal Processing (DSP) module, I worked on two key components: a lab report and an individual assignment. These projects focused on understanding and applying advanced DSP techniques to analyze signals and filter noise.

Lab Report: Frequency Domain Analysis & Filter Designs
In the lab, I explored the design and implementation of various digital filters using MATLAB. The main focus was on Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) filters, such as the Butterworth filter, and Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filters using a Hamming window. I successfully implemented high-pass and band-stop filters, tested them with multiple signal inputs, and evaluated their frequency responses. The lab involved the simulation of these filters to understand their real-world applications in audio and signal processing, including removing unwanted frequencies and improving signal quality.

Assignment: Audio Processing Application for Speech Enhancement
In the individual assignment, I developed an audio processing application using MATLAB App Designer. The application integrates various filtering techniques, including the Kalman Filter, Spectral Subtraction, Butterworth, and Chebyshev filters, to remove noise such as white, Gaussian, pink, and Brownian noise from audio signals. The app allows users to record, load, and apply filters to audio files, providing a user-friendly interface with real-time feedback. The project focused on enhancing speech signals in noisy environments and included a detailed analysis of how each filter performs in different scenarios. I also implemented additional features like theme customization, error validation, and export functionality.
